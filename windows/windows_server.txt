# Server Core vs Windows Server with Desktop
Core - No GUI (~4GB)
Some apps not support on Core
Mainly use 'sconfig' on Powershell (Menu driven CLI app)
Apps available on Core:
- notepad
- task manager (taskmgr)
- regedit
- system info (msinfo32)
- powershell

# Important types of Networks  
- Workgroup (default network)
- Domain


# Workgroup
Small network
No centralised authentication & admin
Max 20 computers
Low security
Each computer is configured individually


# Domain
Centralised Auth & Admin
Unlimited number of computers
High security

# Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Terms
Logical Components (design)
- Domains
    - A repo of User, Computer and other objects
    - A replication boundary
    - An administrative boundary (Admins have full access to all users under domain)
- Domain Trees
    - A relationship between domains
    - example.com the parent of sub1.example.com
    - sub2.example.com is a sibling to sub1.example.com
- Forest
    - A security boundary
    - One or more domains or domain trees that share a trust relationship
    - A group of domain trees
- OUs
- Containers
Physical Components (servers)
- Domain Controllers
    - Server that has AD DS installed
- Read-only Domain Controllers

# Set up Active Directory on server
Server Manager -> Local Server
Manage -> Add Roles & Features
Role-based or feature-based installation
Pick server
Select "Active Directory Domain Services"
Promote server to domain controller when done installing

# AD DS objects
User objects - Access & Auth of user at logon
Group objects - Simplifies permissions for Users
Computer objects - Authenticates against the domain controller
Organisation Units (OUs) - Configure objects by assigning Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to them.
Containers 
- Group objects within a domain. 
- Cannot apply GPOs.
- Assigned to default objects

# Manage Users in AD DS
Server Manager -> Local Server
Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers
Find domain & open it > Users

Domain Controllers
- Servers that host the AD DS database (ntds.dit)
- Also host SYVOL (share folder that stores active directory policies and scripts)
- Host the Kerberos authentication service

Global Catalog
- Hosts a partial attribute set for other domains in the Forest
- Supports queries for objects throughout the Forest
- In a single domain, all domain controllers should hold a copy of the global catalog
- If organisation has multiple sites, each should have a global catalog server

Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Used to enforce settings for users and computers
- Typically used for the following:
    - Security settings
    - Desktop app settings
    - Deploying apps
    - Folder redirection
    - Network settings
- 2 GPOs are created by default
    - Default domain Policy (Users and Computers)
    - Default Domain Controllers Policy

# Add GPOs
Server Manager -> Local server
Tools > Group Policy Management
Select domain
Group Policy Objects
Right-click > New
Set name

Group Policy Preference
- Collection of Group Policy client-side-extensions
- Delivers preferred settings to domain-joined computers
- Users can modify them e.g. Choosing a printer that's not a default
- Can be targeted to specific objects (groups, IPs, etc)

GPO Scope and Inheritance
# From weakest to strongest. OU GPOs override the others
1. Local GPOs (gpedit.msc)
2 Site-level GPO (AD site level)
3. Domain-level GPOs (Affects users & computers in domain)
4. Organisational Unit GPOs (Affects users & computers in specific OU)


# Altering Group Policy Processing
- Block Inheritance
- Enforce
- Security Filtering
